"""
This script, `opentol.py`, is responsible for retrieving a subtree from the Open Tree of Life (OpenTOL) Web Service API 
using a list of OpenTOL IDs and processing the subtree.

The script performs the following steps:
1. Connects to the OpenTOL Web Service API.
2. Sends a request to the API to retrieve a subtree induced by the list of OpenTOL IDs. If the request fails due to 
   unknown IDs, it removes these IDs from the list and tries again.
3. Reads the subtree from the response in Newick format.
4. Processes the tip and node labels of the subtree to keep only the OpenTOL ID or most recent common ancestor (MRCA) 
   ID.
5. If the response includes a list of 'broken' tips, it finds the MRCA placeholder for each broken tip in the subtree 
   and grafts a new leaf labeled with the OpenTOL ID onto the MRCA.
6. Removes unbranched internal nodes from the subtree.
7. Removes labels from interior nodes of the subtree.

The script uses a function argument for the list of OpenTOL IDs. The script is imported by other scripts in the workflow
to retrieve and process a subtree from the OpenTOL Web Service API.
